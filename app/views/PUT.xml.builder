# *Description*
#   This XML template represents a POST response. A POST response is identical
#   as a GET response for now.
#   We could have reused GET template but in order to accomodate any future
#   extentions, we've adopted it separately.
#   
#   == Conventions
#      Conventions are same as for GET template for now
