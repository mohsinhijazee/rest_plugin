# *Description*
#   This templae renders a sinlge resource and it is always rendered as partial.
#   It is called by following views:
#     * GET.xml.builder
#     * GETALL.xml.builder
#     * PUT.xml.builder
#     
#   == Conventions
#     * The resource being rendered is always available as a local variable to
#       this template of same name as of this template. For example, if the 
#       template name is _relation_type.xml.builder then the resource to be
#       rendered will be available as relation_type.
#       
#     * At the very outset, URL of the resource is rendered
#     
#     * Next, all the attributes of the resource are rendered.
#     
#     * Lastly, any addtional URLs are added to it.
#     
#     * Any attributes that should not be rendered are listed in the array naemed
#       'to_be_skipped'
#     

# Add any attributes that should not be part of the representation here
to_be_skipped = [
                  'id',
                  'account_id'
                ]
#FIXME: udner a resource tag? or account_type tag?
#resource tag adds an additional key of type to JSON
#xml.resource(:type => 'account_type') do
xml.database do
  # The URL of the resource
  xml.url url(database_url(database))
  
  # List all the attributes
  database.attributes.each do |attr, value|
    next if to_be_skipped.include? attr
    xml.tag!(attr.to_sym, value)
  end
  
  # Add any other URLs here.
  xml.account_url  url(account_url(:id => database.account_id))
  xml.entities_url url(database_entities_url(:database_id => database.id))
  xml.details_url  url(database_details_url(:database_id => database.id))
