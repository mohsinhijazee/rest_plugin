# *Description*
#   This templae renders a sinlge resource and it is always rendered as partial.
#   It is called by following views:
#     * GET.xml.builder
#     * GETALL.xml.builder
#     * PUT.xml.builder
#     
#   == Conventions
#     * The resource being rendered is always available as a local variable to
#       this template of same name as of this template. For example, if the 
#       template name is _relation_type.xml.builder then the resource to be
#       rendered will be available as relation_type.
#       
#     * At the very outset, URL of the resource is rendered
#     
#     * Next, all the attributes of the resource are rendered.
#     
#     * Lastly, any addtional URLs are added to it.
#     
#     * Any attributes that should not be rendered are listed in the array naemed
#       'to_be_skipped'
#     

# Add any attributes that should not be part of the representation here
to_be_skipped = [
                  :id
                ]


# Add all the URLs to this model
hash = detail_status.attributes.symbolize_keys

hash[:url]  = url(detail_status_url(detail_status))

# Remove any keys
to_be_skipped.each {|attr| hash.delete attr} 

hash.to_xml  :builder        => xml,
             :root           => 'detail_status', 
             :dasherize      => false,
