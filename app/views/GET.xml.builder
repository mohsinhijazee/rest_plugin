# *Descritpion*
#   This XML template renders all the GET REST calls. In order to full fill the
#   request, the partial template in the subdirectory of that type of resource 
#   is rendered. This is a highly DRY approach where we use single builder
#   for serving all the templates.
#   
#   == Conventions:
#     * The resources from the rendering controller is always recieved
#       in an instance variable @resource.
#     * The @resource is passed in :object key which appears to the rendering
#       template as a local variable of same name as the name of template is
#       (This is Rails convention that :object would appear as local variable
#       as name of template).
#       
#   == Example:
#     Suppose an Entity resource of id 5 is required. 
#        * The call would go to Rest::EntitiesController#show method.
#        * Rest::EntitiesController#show will find entity of id 5 and would store 
#          it in instance variable @resource.
#        * Rest::EntitiesController#show will render GET.xml.builder template
#          which is the file you're reading now.
#        * This template renders the template under views/rest/entities/_entity.xml.builder
#          and passes the @resource under the key of :object. Now by Rails 
#          convention, the @resource would appear to the partial template as a
#          local variable named after the file name of template i.e. entity
#        
# TODO: What else should be passed to partial template as locals?
# Nothing else, because all is available as resource
