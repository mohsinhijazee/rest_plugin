# *Description*
#   This standard XML template renders all the GETALL calls. GETALL call is a 
#   simple GET request but it returns a collection of resources. All GETALL calls
#   in Dedomenon return a resource parcel which contains meta information about
#   the resource being returend like total number of resources, ordering information,
#   any conditions applied to them.
#   
#   == Conventions
#       * The resource parcel is always recieved in @parcel instance variable
#         from the index method of the controller.
#       * Meta information about parcel is rendered here.
#       * For the rest of the resources, appropiate xml builder from the views/rest
#         is called. Which view to call? This is indicated in @parcel[:resource_type]
#         and is set by the get_paginated_records method.
#       * After rendering the resutls placed under resources tag. This tag has
#         a 'type' attribute set to 'array' This would help conversion to JSON
#         as it will be converted into an array then.
#       
#       
#

# Render the appropiate resource template from views/rest
resource_type = params[:controller][/\w+$/].singularize
resources = render( :partial => resource_type + '.xml.builder', 
                    :collection => @parcel[:resources])

# Now delete the resources
@parcel.delete :resources

# Convert the parcel to XML via xml builder
@parcel.to_xml(:builder => xml,       :root => 'resource_parcel',

    xml_builder << resources
  end
end
