module Rest::RestHelper
  # *Description*
  #   This method takes a URL and adds extention of the same format as that of 
  #   request. For example, if the request was like this:
  #   GET /databases.json
  #   Then all the URLs in the response would endup with .json extention
  def url(url)
    return url if params[:format].nil?
    return "#{url}.#{params[:format]}"
  end
