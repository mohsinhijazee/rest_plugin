module Rest::RestHelper
  # *Description*
  #   This method takes a URL and adds extention of the same format as that of 
  #   request. For example, if the request was like this:
  #   GET /databases.json
  #   Then all the URLs in the response would endup with .json extention
  def url(url)
    return url if params[:format].nil?
    return "#{url}.#{params[:format]}"
  end
  
  # *Description*
#  This method takes a hash which describes a detail valu.e
# if the datatype is the one which holds files, then value is replaced with URL
# instead of the YAML. This is a workaround and it should not be this way.
# get_records_for should populate value items with proper class objects instead
# of hashes. This will eliminate this approach where we have to list every external 
# datatype.
