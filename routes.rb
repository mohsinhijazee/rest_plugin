#    Below is the list of resources available so far. The respective id of each resourec
#    just after it is implicit. For the last resource, its always :id otherwise
#    its of the form :SingularFormOfResource_id like for entities, its :entity_id
#    
#    TODO: Add the route for links!

  # For each resoruce exposed, you get following methods:
  # _url full URL has a formatted version also
  # _path only path has a formatted version also
  # 
  # hash_for would return which controller, method etc.
  # For exmaple, if you exposed resource databases wtih following:
  # map.resources :databases
  # Then you have following:
  # databases_url
  # databases_path
  # hash_for_databases_url
  # hash_for_databases_path
  # formatted_databases_url
  # formatted_databases_path
